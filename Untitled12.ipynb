        "1. What is hypothesis testing in statistics ?\n",
        "- Hypothesis testing in statistics is a method used to make decisions or inferences about a population based on sample data. It helps determine whether there is enough statistical evidence in favor of a certain belief (called a hypothesis) about a parameter (like a population mean or proportion).\n",
        "2. What is the null hypothesis, and how does it differ from the alternative hypothesis ?\n",
        "- The null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis are foundational concepts in statistical hypothesis testing.\n",
        "Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Ha):\n",
        "Definition: A statement that contradicts the null hypothesis. It suggests that there is an effect, a difference, or a relationship.\n",

        "3. What is the significance level in hypothesis testing, and why is it important ?\n",
        "- he significance level in hypothesis testing, commonly denoted by α (alpha), is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true — in other words, it's the risk of making a Type I error\n",
        "Controls the Risk of False Positives:\n",
        "\n",
        "Setting α = 0.05 means you're accepting a 5% chance of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis. This helps balance the risk of drawing incorrect conclusions from random variability.\n",

        "Sets the Threshold for Statistical Significance:\n",
        "\n",

        "7. What is the difference between a one-tailed and a two-tailed test in hypothesis testing ?\n",
        "- A one-tailed test is used when the research hypothesis predicts a specific direction of the effect (either an increase or a decrease, but not both).\n",

        "- The Z-test is a type of statistical hypothesis test used to determine whether there is a significant difference between sample and population means, or between two sample means, under certain conditions. It is based on the Z-distribution, which is a standard normal distribution (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1).\n",

        "9.  How do you calculate the Z-score, and what does it represent in hypothesis testing ?\n",
        "- A Z-score (also known as a standard score) tells you how many standard deviations a data point is from the population mean. It's a way to compare results from a sample to a standard normal distribution (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1).\n",

        "13. What is the relationship between Z-test and T-test in hypothesis testing ?\n",
        "- In hypothesis testing, both the Z-test and the T-test are statistical tests used to determine if there is a significant difference between sample data and a population parameter or between two groups. They are similar in purpose but differ in their use cases and assumptions. Here's an overview of their relationship and distinctions:\n",
        "Population Standard Deviation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Z-test: Requires knowledge of the population standard deviation (σ). It is typically used when the population standard deviation is known or the sample size is large (n > 30).\n",

        "14.  What is a confidence interval, and how is it used to interpret statistical results ?\n",
        "- A confidence interval (CI) is a range of values, derived from a sample of data, that is used to estimate an unknown population parameter (like the population mean or proportion). The confidence interval provides a range of plausible values for that parameter, based on the sample data and a specified level of confidence.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Elements of a Confidence Interval:\n",
        "Point Estimate: This is the statistic computed from the sample data (e.g., sample mean, sample proportion), which serves as the best estimate of the population parameter.\n",

        "Margin of Error: This represents the uncertainty or variability in the estimate. It reflects how much the point estimate might differ from the true population parameter due to sampling variability.\n",
        "15. What is the margin of error, and how does it affect the confidence interval ?\n",
        "- The margin of error is a measure of the uncertainty or potential error in the results of a statistical estimate. It tells us how much the estimated value might differ from the true population value. It's often used in surveys or polls to express the range within which the true value is likely to fall.\n",
        "The margin of error is typically calculated using the sample size, variability in the data, and the confidence level you want to achieve. It's usually expressed as a plus-or-minus value (e.g., ± 3%).\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if a poll estimates that 60% of people support a candidate, and the margin of error is ±3%, this means that the true support could be anywhere between 57% and 63%.\n",
        "16. How is Bayes' Theorem used in statistics, and what is its significance ?\n",
        "- Bayes' Theorem is a fundamental concept in probability and statistics that describes how to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. It's especially significant in areas involving inference, decision-making under uncertainty, and learning from data.\n",
        "Statistical Inference (Bayesian Statistics)\n",
        "\n",

        "The Chi-square test for independence examines whether two categorical variables are independent or associated. For example, you might use this test to see if there is a relationship between gender and voting preference. Data is typically presented in a contingency table, and the Chi-square statistic is computed to test for independence between variables.\n",
        "18. What is the Chi-square goodness of fit test, and how is it applied ?\n",
        "- The Chi-square goodness of fit test is a statistical test used to determine whether an observed distribution of data matches an expected distribution.

        "Calculate the expected frequencies:\n",
        "These are based on the assumption of the null hypothesis. If, for example, you are testing a die, the expected frequency for each side would be the total number of rolls divided by the number of sides (e.g., if you roll a die 60 times, each side would be expected to appear 10 times).\n",
        "19. What is the F-distribution, and when is it used in hypothesis testing ?\n",
        "- The F-distribution is a probability distribution that arises frequently in statistical inference, particularly in hypothesis testing and analysis of variance (ANOVA). It is used primarily to test the equality of variances and compare the goodness of fit between statistical models.\n",

It's commonly used in analysis of variance (ANOVA) and in regression analysis. The F-test helps determine if the variability between group means is greater than the variability within groups, or if a model explains more variance than would be expected by chance.\n",
